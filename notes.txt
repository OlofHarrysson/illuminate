Controlls:
Time control: Slider with one knob - for looking through time
An openable modal/popover that says which controls goes to what graphs
Tooltip info logo next to each control

from within a train.py script - log data to illuminator. Illuminator checks wheter a new view or component to view is added. If so, it rebuilds the layout and starts the dash app again.

Streaming data to flask vs saving file
Streaming data is quicker and doesn't bloat disk space if data is large
Saving file seems easier and allows for more complex features?


~~~~ Layout ~~~~~
Try connecting view dropdown to grid-layout. For invis stuff, put the w,h=0 or translate it off screen or something.



~~~~ Server data ~~~~
Store everything on disk
Start server. (Check periodically if server needs to restard to get e.g. new callbacks?)
In server startup, load data from disk and store in ServersideOutputs
When a user interacts with controlls e.g. sliders, get the data from the ServersideOutputs, apply transformation and output the result to figures.
