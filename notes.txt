Start with empty one page app with a few controls at top
You can select one (or more experiments) from a dropdown / regex.
You can switch views by some tab mechanic. (or dropdown?)

The view should have a layout, even if it's minimum. Each layout componenent can take data-content.

Create a few common views - like scalar and images. Ability to create own, and share it.

(might not be needed - dynamic layout is possible)
from within a train.py script - log data to illuminator. Illuminator checks wheter a new view or component to view is added. If so, it rebuilds the layout and starts the dash app again.



Start dash in separate terminal. Only takes simple commands such as port, etc. This is because you want to look at the dashboard after training has completed.

Send data from client (train.py). Also specify the layout here? How to send the layout to the server?
